# BMI_Calculator
## Usage
To start the program, type `python BMI_Calculator.py` on the command line
The following message will be shown:

* `Choose Calculation Mode:`
* `1. kilograms in weight and meters in height`
* `2. pounds in weight and inches in height`
* `Please type 1 or 2.`
* `Your Choice:`

Then you will be prompted to enter number 1 or 2 based on your unit preference.

You may automatically start from the beginning if you entered something other than 1 or 2.

After entering the calculation mode, you are either directed to

* `What's your weight in kilograms:`
* `What's your height in meters:`

or:

* `What's your weight in pounds:`
* `What's your height in inches:`

Again, you may automatically start from the beginning if you entered something other than pure number.

After the information is given, you will see 

* `Your BMI is xxxxxxxx` (This is your BMI)
* `You are xxxxxxxx` (This is your diagnosis based on your BMI)

It won't quit until you type valid numbers into the prompt.

Once it gives you the diagnosis, it will quit automatically.
